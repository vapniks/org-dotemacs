;; Keeping your emacs config in an org file makes it easier for you to keep your .emacs under control,
;; and avoid DotEmacsBankruptcy.
;; With your config code stored in an org file you can easily edit the structure and keep notes.
;; Note: it can also be used for organizing other elisp config files such as .gnus.el and .ercrc.el.
;; 
;; This library allows you to load elisp code from an org file on emacs startup.
;; You can also limit the code that is loaded to certain tagged headers using an org tag match,
;; and specify dependencies between code blocks.
;; Using tag matches you can also reuse the same org file for different emacs setups by specifying different
;; tag matches for each setup, or load parts of the file on demand.
;; 
;;; Commands/Usage 
;; 
;; The main command is `org-dotemacs-load-default' which loads your default org-dotemacs file (~/.dotemacs.org)
;; and prompts for a tag match to specify which code blocks to load. 
;; In this way you can load bits of config code when you need them.
;; 
;; You can also put this command in your InitFile (see Installation below) to load the code on startup.
;; To change the default org file use the `org-dotemacs-default-file' option.
;; If you want to load a different org file from your default one, use `org-dotemacs-load-file'.
;; 
;; For faster loading you may prefer to keep your config code in a separate elisp file, and just update this file now and again
;; by exporting the code from the org file.
;; Use the `org-dotemacs-load-file' command for this and specify a target elisp file when prompted.
;; 
;;; Structure of the org file 
;; 
;; The elisp code should be contained in emacs-lisp code blocks, e.g:
;; 
;; #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; (setq line-number-mode t)
;; (setq column-number-mode t)
;; (setq frame-title-format "%b")
;; (set-background-color "Black")
;; (set-foreground-color "White")
;; (set-cursor-color "White")
;; #+END_SRC
;; 
;; Ideally you should have each code block under a separate org subtree, then you can use properties to
;; name the blocks and define dependencies, and tags and todo states to specify which blocks
;; should be loaded (see below). You can specify that certain blocks are loaded only when certain conditions hold
;; by customizing `org-dotemacs-conditional-tags'. By default operating system tags (linux, windows, mac, hurd, freebsd,
;; unix) are set to only load when the corresponding operating system is being used (as reported by the `system-type' variable).
;; So for example, any blocks tagged with "linux" will only be loaded if `system-type' is eq to 'gnu/linux.
;; These conditional tags are overridden by any tag-match supplied to the command line.
;; 
;; I prefer to keep all my code block subtrees under a single header, and use other headers for keeping notes,
;; defining buffer-wide properties, etc. This way I can get a nice column view of the code blocks
;; (see the columns view section below).
;; 
;;;  Block dependencies 
;; 
;; You can enforce dependencies between code blocks by defining NAME & DEPENDS properties for the subtrees containing the
;; blocks (preferred). The NAME property should contain the name of the block, and the DEPENDS property should contain a space
;; separated list of block names that this block depends on.
;; These properties will be applied to all code blocks in the subtree (see "Properties and Columns" in the org manual for
;; more details).
;; 
;; The NAME property can be overridden on a per block basis by adding a :name header arg to a block, and dependencies can be
;; augmented by adding a :depends header arg (see "Header arguments" in the org manual).
;; However it is recommended to keep a separate subtree for each code block and use properties for defining headers and names
;; since then you can get a column view of the dependencies (see below).
;; 
;; A block will not be loaded until all of its dependencies have been loaded.
;; 
;;;  Tags and TODO states 
;; 
;; You can tag your subtrees and use tag matches to specify which blocks to evaluate in calls to `org-dotemacs-load-file'
;; and `org-dotemacs-load-default'. See "Matching tags and properties" in the org manual for more information on tag matches.
;; 
;; Also, by default any blocks in a subtree marked with a todo state of BROKEN will not be evaluated.
;; You can specify which TODO states to include/exclude for evaluation by customizing the `org-dotemacs-include-todo' and
;; `org-dotemacs-exclude-todo' options.
;; 
;; To add the BROKEN state to the list of todo states for the file you need to add buffer-wide todo states by adding a line
;; like this somewhere in your org file (see "Per file keywords" in the org manual).
;; 
;; #+TODO: BROKEN CHECK TODO
;; 
;;;  Columns View 
;; 
;; If you use properties for defining names and dependencies then you can get a nice column view of your code subtrees
;; with the following columns view specification:
;; 
;; #+COLUMNS: %35ITEM %15NAME %35DEPENDS %15TAGS %TODO
;; 
;; This can be placed anywhere in your dotemacs org file.
;; Then if you press C-c C-x C-c on the toplevel header for your code blocks you'll get a column view that allows you
;; to easily change the names, dependencies, tags and todo states.
;; 
;;;  Error handling 
;; 
;; Error handling can be controlled by customizing `org-dotemacs-error-handling' or by setting the error-handling
;; command line option when starting emacs.
;; By default code blocks with unmet dependencies or errors are skipped over as soon as an error is encountered,
;; but you can also specify that org-dotemacs should halt or try to reload the blocks.
;; In the latter case each time a new block is successfully loaded, any unsuccessful blocks will be retried.
;; 
;;;  Command line options 
;; 
;; org-dotemacs.el will look for two command line options when loaded: error-handling (for setting the value of
;; `org-dotemacs-error-handling') and tag-match (for specifying which headers to load).
;; For example if you enter the following at the command line:
;; 
;;        emacs --error-handling retry --tag-match "settings-mouse"
;; 
;; Then only code blocks tagged "settings" but not "mouse" will be loaded, and org-dotemacs will try to reload any
;; blocks that have errors. If no tag-match is specified on the command line then `org-dotemacs-conditional-tags'
;; will be used to determine which blocks can be loaded by default.
;; 
;;;  Installation 
;; 
;; Put org-dotemacs.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
;; You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;; where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
;; (you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
;; 
;; Then make sure you have an ~/.dotemacs.org file and add the following lines to
;; the end of your .emacs file:
;; 
;; (load-file "~/.emacs.d/org-dotemacs.el")
;; (let (find-file-hook) (org-dotemacs-load-default))
;; 
;; or if you want to just load code blocks matching a tag match:
;; 
;; (load-file "~/.emacs.d/org-dotemacs.el")
;; (let (find-file-hook) (org-dotemacs-load-default "<TAG-MATCH>"))
;; 
;; To load a different org file either customize `org-dotemacs-default-file' or use the
;; `org-dotemacs-load-file' function, e.g:
;; 
;; (load-file "~/.emacs.d/org-dotemacs.el")
;; (let (find-file-hook) (org-dotemacs-load-file "<TAG-MATCH>" "~/.emacs.d/my_emacs_config.org"))
;; 


;;; Customize:
;;
;; `org-dotemacs-conditional-tags' : A list of tags/regexps and corresponding conditions for loading blocks.
;; `org-dotemacs-default-file' : The default org file containing the code blocks to load when `org-dotemacs-load-file' is called.
;; `org-dotemacs-error-handling' : Indicates how errors should be handled by `org-dotemacs-load-blocks'.
;; `org-dotemacs-include-todo' : A regular expression matching TODO states to be included.
;; `org-dotemacs-exclude-todo' : A regular expression matching TODO states to be excluded.
;;
;; All of the above can customized by:
;;      M-x customize-group RET org-dotemacs RET
